## **Features**
- **JSON to Markdown Conversion**:
  - Converts vulnerability data in JSON format into a well-structured Markdown report.
- **Customizable Input and Output**:
  - Specify input JSON file and output Markdown file.
- **Preformatted Report Layout**:
  - Automatically organizes vulnerabilities by severity with descriptions, impacts, and remediations.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**:
  - Built with Go for speed and simplicity.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YamatoGr93/VulnerabilityReportGenerator.git
   cd VulnerabilityReportGenerator
   ```

2. **Build the Tool**:
   Compile the tool into a binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o vulnerability-report-generator main.go
   ```

3. **Run the Tool**:
   Use the compiled binary:
   ```bash
   ./vulnerability-report-generator -i <input_file> -o <output_file>
   ```

---

## **Usage**
```bash
go run main.go -i <input_file> -o <output_file>
```

### **Available Flags**
| Flag             | Description                                           | Default                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `-i`             | Path to the input JSON file                           | `report.json`           |
| `-o`             | Path to the output Markdown file                      | `vulnerability_report.md` |

---

## **Examples**
### **Generate a Vulnerability Report**
```bash
go run main.go -i report.json -o vulnerability_report.md
```
Reads the JSON file `report.json` and generates a Markdown report in `vulnerability_report.md`.

---

## **JSON Input Format**
The input JSON file must follow this structure:
```json
{
  "target": "http://localhost:3000",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "name": "SQL Injection",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection on the login form.",
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve or modify sensitive data in the database.",
      "remediation": "Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "User input is not sanitized on the comment form, allowing XSS attacks.",
      "impact": "An attacker can execute malicious scripts in a user's browser.",
      "remediation": "Sanitize and validate all user inputs."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## **Output Example**
A sample Markdown report:
```markdown
# Vulnerability Report

**Target:** http://localhost:3000

## Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection
**Severity:** High

**Description:**  
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection on the login form.

**Impact:**  
An attacker can retrieve or modify sensitive data in the database.

**Remediation:**  
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

---

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Severity:** Medium

**Description:**  
User input is not sanitized on the comment form, allowing XSS attacks.

**Impact:**  
An attacker can execute malicious scripts in a user's browser.

**Remediation:**  
Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
```

## **Planned Enhancements**
1. **Support for Additional Output Formats**:
   - Add support for PDF or HTML output for more flexibility.
2. **Customizable Report Templates**:
   - Enable users to define custom templates for the Markdown report.
3. **Bulk Processing**:
   - Add support for processing multiple JSON files simultaneously.
